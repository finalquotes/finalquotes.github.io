<title>finalquotes | This is a small archive showcasing the many quotes and phrases said by various #finalchan users. I made this out of both boredom and the fact that we lost our old quote archive along with our brave bot, lolibot. So take a trip down meme-ory lane, relive past times, and enjoy the unfiltered shitposting spanning almost five years. This is a work in progress being carried out by one individual, and therefore it will take a while to finish. Hopefully it will continue to be updated regularly. And finally, remember; post ti finalchan.</title>
