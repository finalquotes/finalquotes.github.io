I made this out of both boredom and the fact that we lost our  old quote archive along with our brave bot, lolibot. So take a trip down meme-ory lane,  relive past times, and enjoy the unfiltered shitposting spanning almost five years.  This is a work in progress being carried out by one individual, and therefore it will take a while to finish.  Hopefully it will continue to be updated regularly. And finally, remember; post ti finalchan.</subtitle></feed>
