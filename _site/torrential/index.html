<hr />

<p>2015-04-10 15:43:16	&gt;	Torr stands behind pac, so close that the warm exhale of breath softly flows through pac’s neck hairs. The skin shivers slightly, tingling, as his body struggles to 
maintain it’s composure. Be still… his whisper isn’t heard by the others, and pac remains in place, anticipating the next warm, humid exhalation.</p>
