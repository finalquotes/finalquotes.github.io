# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  This is a small archive showcasing the many quotes and phrases said by various 
  #finalchan users. I made this out of both boredom and the fact that we lost our 
  old quote archive along with our brave bot, lolibot. So take a trip down meme-ory lane, 
  relive past times, and enjoy the unfiltered shitposting spanning almost five years. 
  This is a work in progress being carried out by one individual, and therefore it will take a while to finish. 
  Hopefully it will continue to be updated regularly. And finally, remember; post ti finalchan.
